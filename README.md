To keep the Discord Rust area as clear as possible, only as many voice channels as necessary are automatically created and deleted again.

## üíª Install <a name = "usage"></a>
1. [ ] Clone the Git
```cmd 
    git clone https://github.com/NapoII/Discord_Rust_Team_Bot
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```


2. [ ] Create a Discord bot on the Discord Dev website:
   https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true


3. [ ] Enter the token and app id in the [token.ini](Discord_Rust_Team_bot/config/token.ini)
```ini
[discord]
discord_bot_name = 
token = 
application_id =
```
4. [ ] Add the Discord Bot to your Discord Server.
5. [ ] Add the Discord ID (Guild_ID) to the [config.ini](Discord_Rust_Team_bot/config/config.ini)
```ini
[client]
guild_name = 
guild_id = 
activity = Bubbly dubly wubly
praefix = !
```
6. [ ] You don't need to change the rest of the configuration, the bot will do that on its own. Only if you have some channels that you need to merge in to the bot.

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "Use"></a>

start Discord_Rust_Team_Bot.py directly from the folder or run in cmd:
```cmd
cd <local path of Discord_Rust_Team_Bot>
python Discord_Rust_Team_Bot.py
```

When the bot is started for the first time, it will create the necessary channels and files. Afterward, it will prompt you to set permissions for the respective commands in your Discord Server's CMD channel. Once you've completed these steps, restart the bot, and you're ready to use it. Have fun!
