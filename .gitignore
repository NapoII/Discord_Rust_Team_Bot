#  Git Ignore File
# 
#  This file is used to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
#  You can use various operators and patterns to match files and directories.
#
#  Here are some examples of patterns you can use:
#
#  *       Matches zero or more characters in a filename or path segment.
#  ?       Matches any single character in a filename or path segment.
#  **      Matches any number of directories (including none) in a pathname.
#  !       Negates a pattern, so files that match will not be ignored.
#  #       Indicates a comment, which is ignored by Git.
#           
#  Here are some examples of how to use these patterns:
#
#  *.pyc          Matches any files ending with .pyc.
#  test/          Matches the directory 'test'.
#  **/test/       Matches any directory named 'test', regardless of where it is in the directory tree.
#  build/*        Matches any files in the 'build' directory, but not the directory itself.
#  !build/*.txt   Does not ignore any .txt files in the 'build' directory, even though 'build/' is ignored.
#
