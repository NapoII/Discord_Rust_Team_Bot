### TODO

---

#### Basic
- [x] New project generated with `[New_py_Code]`
- [ ] Initialise a new Git with Git Bash:
    ```Git Bash
    git init
    git add.
    git commit -"Hello world"
    ```
- [ ] Create a new repository on gitHub: https://github.com/new
- [ ] Add the desired licence, for example: `MIT License` 

- [ ] Create remote access to the repository with Git Bash and push the project to GitHub.
    ```Git Bash
    git remote o https://github.com/<GitHub User name>/<repository name>
    git push o main
    ```
- [ ] ☕ Now that the base is in place Treat yourself to a cup of tea.

---
#### Start

- [ ] Start your coding
- [ ] end big step with a git commit. Add files/folders previously locked to Git to the `.gitignore` as needed. 
    ```Git Bash
    git add .
    git commit "<text>"
    git push o main
    ```
- [ ] ☕ Now that the first code is up, take some time for Tea again and write down your next steps here in the TODO file.
- [ ] 

#### The Finish

- [ ] Run the code for the final test
- [ ] If the code does what it is supposed to do, do another push into git and go into finishing.
    ```Git Bash
    git add .
    git commit "Finel Test is over!"
    git push o main
    ```
- [ ] Delete all folders and files you no longer need.
- [ ] If necessary, change `log("str)` to `print("str")` or delete the `print()` directly.
- [ ] Check your code and files for missing dokus. *ChatGPT kann dir die arbeit abnehmen use: 
    ```ChatGPT promt:
        write me a .py docstr ("""""") with the content: 
        Args, Returns, Example Usage for the code in eng.
        Use for Args and Returns "- " for a listing and for Example Usage: ">>> ".
        Here is the code: <your code Snippet>
        ```
- [ ] If you have used another language translate the code into english.
- [ ] Complete the `requirements.txt` list.
- [ ] Delete all private data from the config file.
- [ ] ☕ Have a Tea and think about the content of the ReadMe.
- [ ] Write the readme.
- [ ] check the `setup.py` if it still exists.
- [ ] check the `.gitignor` file.
- [ ] Final git Push:
    ```Git Bash
        git add .
        git commit "Touchdown! "
        git push o main
        ```
- [ ] Upload to pypi if desired : *nice guide for pypi publishing https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/python-for-hpc/tutorials/python-pypi-packaging/*
